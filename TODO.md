# To do

Roughly in the order we expect to tackle them. Done items move to the
bottom with the date.

## Art

- [ ] **Night variants** for the other exteriors (village and residential_street
  would gain most). Harbour, high street and Town Hall are done; make the rest
  the same way (Qwen-Image-Edit with the ref-latent fix, contact sheet first).
- [ ] Re-fit positions set for the placeholders to the art: the lighthouse
  beam origin, the `WATER` shimmer rectangles (the slipway's top strip), and
  the crane and drill tower behind the clock box.
- [ ] Studio sets still to come: a sports corner; bumper and filler cards in
  the same style as the art.
- [ ] Optional parallax: two layers per backdrop.
- [ ] Real character sprites for all eight presenters (Dana, Gordon, Miles,
  Rosie, Jonah, Pat, Clive, Vincent) and a guest set, keeping the
  `draw_character` signature (idle / talking / gesture states).

## Content

- [ ] Local adverts (15–30 s) for the town's businesses; double as evergreen filler.
- [ ] Tides and ferry times from a deterministic fake tide table, not the model.
- [ ] *The Last Ferry*: its own set (a late-night desk and couch, made in
  ComfyUI with a contact sheet) to replace the interview set with the lights
  down; perhaps a house band sting and a second, shorter guest.
- [ ] Breakfast extras: tides and adverts on *Morning Tide*; a guest in the
  sofa armchair (the `guest` mark is free).
- [ ] Breaking news from the story desk or the editor (now tip-line only),
  and a follow-up field report from Miles once a breaking story is confirmed.
- [ ] A model-planned running order for the magazine and the talk show (a
  theme and a topic per item) on top of the fixed hour orders.
- [ ] Schedule: whether specials (or later documentaries) get their own
  scheduled slots rather than only after news bumpers.
- [ ] Sport: a fourth presenter and the Tidewater Stadium.
- [ ] The 15–30 minute documentary: specials plus a research step over the
  town's own archive (`world.search_archive`), more sections, archive "footage".
- [ ] Optional real-weather hook mapping the user's city onto Port Wexley.

## Engineering

- [ ] Evergreen pool: pre-bake idents, "coming up" promos and notices in idle
  time so filler is never a bare card.
- [ ] Lock around world state so more than one worker is safe.
- [ ] `world.threads` is capped at 40 by dropping the oldest, even if it is
  still open; with many new threads a day (every guest feature opens one)
  that can drop a live story. Drop closed threads first.
- [ ] Give section writers the thread's dates and beats (the editor already
  sees them) to keep timelines straight.
- [ ] Guest casting: gender hint is in; consider age/accent hints and a wider voice pool.
- [ ] LM Studio provider: verify end to end when the GPU is free; tune the
  9B model's prompt compliance.
- [ ] `record_aired` for a special runs when it is finished, not when it airs, so
  the archive says it aired early. Moving it means a world write from the main
  thread (wait for the world-state lock).
- [ ] Leave it on overnight and read the stats (now with the overnight
  test card, repeats and the editor working through the night).
- [ ] Kimi sometimes writes a spoken line over 900 characters (Miles) and the
  script fails validation once; the retry usually works. Status notes are now
  clipped on parse (`models._clip`); spoken lines aren't, since cutting speech
  mid-sentence is worse than a retry. (Kimi doesn't get the JSON schema
  enforced; `writers._keys_hint` spells out the keys, and the schemas accept
  `speaker_id`, per-line guest details and "female"/"male".)
- [ ] A presenter booked as a guest (Gordon on his ghost tours) is captioned
  with their presenter role; use the script's `guest_role` instead.

## Housekeeping

- [ ] Decide on a licence (none at present; MIT is the usual choice).
- [ ] Decide whether the baked placeholder WAVs should stay in the repo.

## Done

- 2026-10-26 Breakfast variety, from the first real-Kimi morning (61 sofa chats,
  the town's 155th birthday six times, ages that changed between chats): each
  sofa chat is told this morning's sofa headlines, how the earlier chats on its
  angle began, and that an anniversary, birthday, age or date said once is
  settled. Overnight repeats skip breakfast segments (`Show.repeats_overnight`).
  First unit tests: `python -m unittest discover -s tests`.
- 2026-10-25 Breakfast runs a pattern with briefs handed out in turn (twelve
  sofa angles, six report angles), headlines that always lead with the big
  story, and a goodbye before the news.
- 2026-10-25 The producer's planning clock is worked out each tick from what is
  really queued; the old per-slot retime double-counted drift and ran an hour
  ahead in a real run, signing the magazine off at 19:32.
- 2026-10-25 Bulletins lead with a story for two hours after it broke as
  breaking news (as the follow-up of its own thread); breaking news always
  opens a new thread; status notes are clipped instead of failing validation.
- 2026-10-25 Thread ids count on from the highest used: with the list capped at
  40, every new thread had been getting `t041`, and follow-ups landed on the
  wrong story. The ten duplicates in `data/world.json` were renumbered
  `t042`–`t050`.
- 2026-10-25 The cache key includes a slot's running-order part and brief, so a
  restart can't replay a slot planned another way.

- 2026-10-25 Night art for the harbour, high street and Town Hall
  (`<id>_night.png`): lit windows, shop fronts, lamps, the clock face and boat
  lights, from Qwen-Image-Edit 2511 with the reference latent at the output size
  (the stock graph zoomed by 1-4 px). MOSS Edit HQ v4 kept the layout too, but
  went saturated blue and left the clock and shop fronts dark.
- 2026-10-25 Breaking news and the viewer tip-line: lines in `data/tipline.txt`
  (`python -m newsroom.tipline "..."`) go to the next bulletins as viewer tips;
  `BREAKING:` lines interrupt whatever is on at the next sentence, with a sting
  and Dana at the news desk, then the programme resumes. The story broke today
  is the light shows' big running story.
- 2026-10-25 Hour-long running orders for *Coastwide* and *The Last Ferry*: a
  written-out order with a brief per item, the big story only at the top, two-part
  guests on the talk show, and a sign-off before the next show.
- 2026-10-25 Dusk grade: a sunset tint (purple sky to an orange horizon, violet
  water) for art without its own dusk picture; fixes breakfast's first hour too.
- 2026-10-25 Finished specials survive a restart and air once (`<hash>.aired`).

- 2026-10-25 Day-parts, part 2: studio interviews (in the news every third
  loop, on `studio_interview`), *Coastwide* the early-evening magazine (Pat
  Holloway and Clive Ashdown: links, filmed features, studio guest, vox pops,
  consumer slot) and *The Last Ferry* late-night talk show (Vincent Marr:
  monologue and guest chats, a night look on the interview set), and the
  23:00 late news. Guests join the cast, aren't rebooked straight away, and a
  presenter can be a guest.
- 2026-10-25 Day-parts, part 1: `schedule.py` with a normal day (overnight test
  card and repeats, *Morning Tide* breakfast on the sofa with Rosie Treloar and
  Jonah Pike, the news, the magazine slot), per-show casts and schemas, lighter
  breakfast weighting with a big-running-story exception, `--clock HH:MM`.
- 2026-10-25 Studio sets: the interview set and the breakfast sofa, with
  character marks and art.
- 2026-10-25 Backdrop art: ComfyUI pixel art for all 24 locations plus
  `studio_wide` and `weather_wall`, approved on contact sheets.
- 2026-10-24 Milestone 1: looping broadcast, Kokoro voices, Pygame scenes.
- 2026-10-24 Config-driven providers; Kimi via Moonshot.
- 2026-10-24 Special reports, resumable stages, editor.
- 2026-10-24 Story bible: cast, thread arcs, archive, story desk.
- 2026-10-24 Public GitHub repo with README and screenshots.
- 2026-10-25 Studio shots: an anchor close-up cut into bulletins, and a big-picture
  wall (the weather wall showing the location) for field-report and special handovers.
- 2026-10-25 Backdrop system: 24 writer-selectable locations (town and
  countryside) plus studio sets, PNG-or-placeholder loading, day/dusk/night
  and weather grading, animated water and weather, contact sheet and bake tools.
